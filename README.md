# AtliQ Hardware Ad-Hoc Business Insights
## Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world business challenge presented by AtliQ Hardwares, a global computer hardware manufacturer. The task was to solve 10 ad-hoc business questions using SQL and present the findings in a clear, executive-level format. The goal was to identify trends, inefficiencies, and growth opportunities in sales, products, customer performance, and market channels.
The final insights were visualized using Power BI and compiled into a business-ready presentation.

## Objectives
	• Identify high-performing product segments and customer groups.
	• Evaluate the effectiveness of customer discounting strategies.
	• Analyse channel contributions and sales growth patterns.
	• Support decision-making with clear, data-driven insights.

## Key Insights
	• 36% increase in unique products from FY20 to FY21 — a sign of product innovation.
	• Desktop segment had the highest average gross margin per product, while Notebooks had the widest variety but lower margin 
      efficiency.
	• Retail channel contributed 72.86% of gross sales in FY21. However, Distributor and Direct channels showed strong YoY growth.
	• Top 5 customers by discount revealed some clients had relatively lower ROI despite high discounts, highlighting the need for 
      better discount targeting.
	• Created a Power BI dashboard for trends by segment, customer, and month.
